  {"q": "What do you do?", "a": "We provide AI demos and lab tools that answer common questions about our services, policies, and research support."},
  {"q": "What is this demo?", "a": "A small FAQ bot that retrieves answers from a fixed list of Q-A pairs and responds only with known information."},
  {"q": "What model do you use?", "a": "Locally hosted Qwen 3 (Mini 0.6B or Tiny 1.8B) via Ollama, with thinking disabled."},
  {"q": "Do you store my messages?", "a": "For the demo, we do not store chat content server-side. Logs may record aggregate counts and errors only."},
  {"q": "How accurate are the answers?", "a": "The bot only replies using the provided FAQ content. If it is unsure, it will respond with 'I don't know.'"},
  {"q": "Can I ask questions not in the FAQ?", "a": "Yes, but if there is no matching FAQ item, the bot will answer 'I don't know.'"},
  {"q": "How do you find answers?", "a": "We embed each question and use cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant Q-A pairs."},
  {"q": "Which embedding model do you use?", "a": "We use 'nomic-embed-text' from Ollama to create question vectors."},
  {"q": "Can I update the FAQ?", "a": "Yes. Edit qa.json and rebuild the index to update the demo."},
  {"q": "How do I rebuild the index?", "a": "Run build_index.py to regenerate vecs.npy from qa.json."},
  {"q": "What happens if the index is missing?", "a": "The demo will run, but it will answer 'I don't know' for all questions until the index is built."},
  {"q": "Do you support citations?", "a": "Not in this demo. The bot answers only with short text from the FAQ."},
  {"q": "Can I change the model?", "a": "Yes. Set the MODEL environment variable or edit backend.py to select a different Ollama model."},
  {"q": "Does the bot use tools or browsing?", "a": "No. It only uses local embeddings and the FAQ content."},
  {"q": "Can I self-host this?", "a": "Yes. You need Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Uvicorn, NumPy, and a local Ollama daemon."},
  {"q": "How do I run the server?", "a": "Start Ollama, then run 'python backend.py'. The API will be at /chat and /health."},
  {"q": "What is the maximum context size?", "a": "Small. We keep prompts tiny and answers short for speed and stability on small models."},
  {"q": "Will the bot hallucinate?", "a": "It is instructed to reply only from the FAQ. When unsure, it says 'I don't know.'"},
  {"q": "Can I get a copy of the code?", "a": "Yes. This demo includes build_index.py, backend.py, qa.json, and vecs.npy after indexing."},
  {"q": "Who do I contact for support?", "a": "Email support@yourlab.example or use the Contact section on our website."}
